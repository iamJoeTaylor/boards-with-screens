# Boards With Screens

This project is inspired by the [Blocks with Screens](https://github.com/bountylabs/blocks-with-screens) project.

## Components

### Blockware

This is the example software that you can run on the boards. See [blockware/README.md](https://github.com/iamJoeTaylor/boards-with-screens/blob/main/blockware/README.md) for installation instructions and a listing (with gifs!) of the available blockware.
